<p>A MIDSUMMER freshet was running over old Gabe Bunch's water-wheel into
the Cumberland. Inside the mill Steve Marcum lay in one dark corner with
a slouched hat over his face. The boy Isom was emptying a sack of corn
into the hopper. Old Gabe was speaking his mind.</p>

<p>Always the miller had been a man of peace; and there was one time when
he thought the old Stetson-Lewallen feud was done. That was when Rome
Stetson, the last but one of his name, and Jasper Lewallen, the last but
one of his, put their guns down and fought with bare fists on a high
ledge above old Gabe's mill one morning at daybreak. The man who was
beaten was to leave the mountains; the other was to stay at home and have
peace. Steve Marcum, a Stetson, heard the sworn terms and saw the fight.
Jasper was fairly whipped; and when Rome let him up he proved treacherous
and ran for his gun. Rome ran too, but stumbled and fell. Jasper whirled
with his Winchester and was about to kill Rome where he lay, when a
bullet came from somewhere and dropped him back to the ledge again. Both
Steve Marcum and Rome Stetson said they had not fired the shot; neither
would say who had. Some thought one man was lying, some thought the other
was, and Jasper's death lay between the two. State troops came then,
under the Governor 's order, from the Blue Grass, and Rome had to drift
down the river one night in old Gabe's canoe and on Out of the mountains
for good. Martha Lewallen, who, though Jasper's sister, and the last of
the name, loved and believed Rome, went with him. Marcums and Braytons
who had taken sides in the fight hid in the bushes around Hazlan, or
climbed over into Virginia. A railroad started up the Cumberland.
"Furriners came in to buy wild lands and get out timber. Civilization
began to press over the mountains and down on Hazlan, as it had pressed
in on Breathitt, the seat of another feud, in another county. In
Breathitt the feud was long past, and with good reason old Gabe thought
that it was done in Hazlan.</p>

<p>But that autumn a panic started over from England. It stopped the
railroad far down the Cumberland; it sent the "furriners" home, and drove
civilization back. Marcums and Braytons came in from hiding, and drifted
one by one to the old fighting-ground. In time they took up the old
quarrel, and with Steve Marcum and Steve Brayton as leaders, the old
Stetson-Lewallen feud went on, though but one soul was left in the
mountains of either name. That was Isom, a pale little fellow whom Rome
had left in old Gabe's care; and he, though a Stetson and a half-brother
to Rome, was not counted, because he was only a boy and a foundling, and
because his ways were queer.</p>

<p>There was no open rupture, no organized division--that might happen no
more. The mischief was individual now, and ambushing was more common.
Certain men were looking for each other, and it was a question of
"draw-in' quick 'n' shootin' quick" when the two met by accident, or of
getting the advantage "from the bresh."</p>

<p>In time Steve Marcum had come face to face with old Steve Brayton in
Hazlan, and the two Steves, as they were known, drew promptly. Marcum was
in the dust when the smoke cleared away; and now, after three months in
bed, he was just out again. He had come down to the mill to see Isom.
This was the miller's first chance for remonstrance, and, as usual, he
began to lay it down that every man who had taken a human life must
sooner or later pay for it with his own. It was an old story to Isom,
and, with a shake of impatience, he turned out the door of the mill, and
left old Gabe droning on under his dusty hat to Steve, who, being heavy
with "moonshine," dropped asleep.</p>

<p>Outside the sun was warm, the flood was calling from the dam, and the
boy's petulance was gone at once. For a moment he stood on the rude
platform watching the tide; then he let one bare foot into the water,
and, with a shiver of delight, dropped from the boards. In a moment his
clothes were on the ground behind a laurel thicket, and his slim white
body was flashing like a faun through the reeds and bushes up stream. A
hundred yards away the creek made a great loop about a wet thicket of
pine and rhododendron, and he turned across the bushy neck. Creeping
through the gnarled bodies of rhododendron, he dropped suddenly behind
the pine, and lay flat in the black earth. Ten yards through the dusk
before him was the half-bent figure of a man letting an old army
haversack slip from one shoulder; and Isom watched him hide it with a
rifle under a bush, and go noiselessly on towards the road. It was Crump,
Eli Crump, who had been a spy for the Lewallens in the old feud and who
was spying now for old Steve Brayton. It was the second time Isom had
seen him lurking about, and the boy's impulse was to hurry back to the
mill. But it was still peace, and without his gun Crump was not
dangerous; so Isom rose and ran on, and, splashing into the angry little
stream, shot away like a roll of birch bark through the tawny crest of a
big wave. He had done the feat a hundred times; he knew every rock and
eddy in flood-time, and he floated through them and slipped like an eel
into the mill-pond. Old Gabe was waiting for him.</p>

<p>"Whut ye mean, boy," he said, sharply, reskin' the fever an' ager this
way? No wonder folks thinks ye air half crazy. Git inter them clothes now
'n' come in hyeh. You'll ketch yer death o' cold swimmin' this way atter
a fresh."</p>

<p>The boy was shivering when he took his seat at the funnel, but he did
not mind that; some day he meant to swim over that dam. Steve still lay
motionless in the corner near him, and Isom lifted the slouched hat and
began tickling his lips with a straw. Steve was beyond the point of
tickling, and Isom dropped the hat back and turned to tell the miller
what he had seen in the thicket. The dim interior darkened just then, and
Crump stood in the door. Old Gabe stared hard at him without a word of
welcome, but Crump shuffled to a chair unasked, and sat like a toad
astride it, with his knees close up under his arms, and his wizened face
in his hands.</p>

<p>Meeting Isom's angry glance, he shifted his own uneasily.</p>

<p>Seed the new preacher comm' 'long today?" he asked. Drawing one dirty
finger across his forehead, " Got a long scar 'cross hyeh."</p>

<p>The miller shook his head.</p>

<p>Well, he's a-comm'. I've been waitin' fer him up the road, but I
reckon I got to git 'cross the river purty soon now."</p>

<p>Crump had been living over in Breathitt since the old feud. He had
been "convicted" over there by Sherd Raines, a preacher from the Jellico
Hills, and he had grown pious. Indeed, he had been trailing after Raines
from place to place, and he was following the circuit-rider now to the
scene of his own deviltry-Hazlan.</p>

<p>"Reckon you folks don't know I got the cirkit-rider to come over hyeh,
do ye?" he went on. "Ef he can't preach! Well, I'd tell a man! He kin
jus' draw the heart out'n a holler log! He ' convicted ' me fust night,
over thar in Breathitt. He come up thar, ye know, to stop the feud, he
said; 'n' thar was laughin' from one eendo' Breathitt to t'other; but
thar was the whoppinest crowd thar I ever see when he did come. The
meetin'-house wasn't big enough to hold 'em, so he goes out on the aidge
o' town, n' climbs on to a stump. He hed a woman with him from the
settlemints-she's a-waitin' at Hazlan fer him now-'n' she had a cur'us
little box, 'n' he put her 'n' the box on a big rock, 'n' started in a
callin' 'em his bretherin' 'n' sisteren, 'n' folks seed mighty soon thet
he meant it, too. He's always mighty easylike, tell he gits to the
blood-penalty."</p>

<p>At the word, Crump's listeners paid sudden heed. Old Gabe's knife
stopped short in the heart of the stick he was whittling; the boy looked
sharply up from the running meal into Crump's face and sat still.</p>

<p>Well, he jes prayed to the Almighty as though he was a-talkin' to him
face to face, 'n' then the woman put her hands on that box, 'n' the
sweetes' sound anybody thar ever heerd come outen it. Then she got to
singin'. Hit wusn't nuthin' anybody thar'd ever heerd; but some o' the
women folks was a snifflin' 'fore she got through. He pitched right into
the feud, as he calls hit, 'n' the sin o' sheddin' human blood, I tell
ye; 'n' 'twixt him and the soldiers I reckon thar won't be no more
fightin' in Breathitt. He says, 'n' he always says it mighty loud "-Crump
raised his own voice-" thet the man as kills his feller-critter hev some
day got ter give up his own blood, sartin 'n' shore."</p>

<p>It was old Gabe's pet theory, and he was nodding approval. The boy's
parted lips shook with a spasm of fear, and were as quickly shut tight
with suspicion. Steve raised his head as though he too had heard the
voice, and looked stupidly about him.</p>

<p>I tol' him," Crump went on, " thet things was already a-gettin' kind
o' frolicsome round hyeh agin; thet the Marcums 'n' Braytons was a-takin'
up the ole war, 'n' would be a-plunkin' one 'nother every time they got
together, 'n' a-gittin' the whole country in fear 'n' tremblin' -now thet
Steve Marcum had come back."</p>

<p>Steve began to scowl and a vixenish smile hovered at Isom's lips.</p>

<p>He knows mighty well-fer I tol' him-thet thar hain't a wuss man in all
these mountains than thet very Steve-" The name ended in a gasp, and the
wizened gossip was caught by the throat and tossed, chair and all, into a
corner of the mill.</p>

<p>None o' that, Steve! " called the miller, sternly. "Not hyeh. Don't
hurt him now!</p>

<p>Crump's face stiffened with such terror that Steve broke into a
laugh.</p>

<p>Well, ye air a skeery critter! " he said, contemptuously. "I hain't
goin' to hurt him, Uncl' Gabe, but he must be a plumb idgit, a-talkin'
'bout folks to thar face, 'n' him so puny an' spindlin'! You git!</p>

<p>Crump picked himself up trembling-"Don't ye ever let me see ye on this
side o' the river agin, now "-and shuffled out, giving Marcum one look of
fear and unearthly hate.</p>

<p>Convicted '! " snorted Steve. " I heerd old Steve Brayton had hired
him to waylay me, 'n' I swar I believe hit's so."</p>

<p>"Well, he won't hev to give him more'n a chaw o' tobaccer now," said
Gabe. " He'll come purty near doin' hit hisseif, I reckon, ef he gits the
chance."</p>

<p>Well, he kin git the chance ef I gits my leetle account settled with
ole Steve Brayton fust. 'Pears like that old hog ain't satisfied shootin'
me hisself." Stretching his arms with a yawn, Steve winked at Isom and
moved to the door. The boy followed him outside.</p>

<p>"We're goin' fer ole Brayton about the dark o' the next moon, boy," he
said. "He's sort o' s'picious now, 'n' we'll give him a leetle time to
git tame. I'll have a bran'-new Winchester fer ye, Isom. Hit ull be like
ole times agin, when Rome was hyeh. Whut's the matter, boy?" he asked,
suddenly. Isom looked unresponsive, listless.</p>

<p>Air ye gittin' sick agin?</p>

<p>Well, I hain't feelin' much peert, Steve."</p>

<p>Take keer o' yourself, boy. Don't git sick now. We'll have to watch
Eli Crump purty close. I don't know why I hain't killed thet spyin' skunk
long ago, 'ceptin' I never had a shore an' sartin reason fer doin
'it.</p>

<p>Isom started to speak then and stopped. He would learn more first; and
he let Steve go on home unwarned.</p>

<p>The two kept silence after Marcum had gone. Isom turned away from old
Gabe, and stretched himself out on the platform. He looked troubled. The
miller, too, was worried.</p>

<p>Jus' a hole in the groun'," he said, half to himself; "that's whut
we're all comm' to! 'Pears like we mought help one 'nother to keep out'n
hit, 'stid o' holpin' 'em in."</p>

<p>Brown shadows were interlacing out in the mill-pond, where old Gabe's
eyes were intent. A current of cool air had started down the creek to the
river. A katydid began to chant. Twilight was coming, and the miller
rose.</p>

<p>"Hit's a comfort to know you won't be mixed up in all this devilment,"
he said; and then, as though he had found more light in the gloom: "Hit's
a comfort to know the new rider air shorely a-preachin' the right
doctrine, 'n' I want ye to go hear him. Blood for blood-life fer a life!
Your grandad shot ole Tom Lewallen in Hazlan. Ole Jack Lewallen shot him
from the bresh. Tom Stetson killed ole Jack; ole Jass killed Tom, 'n' so
hit comes down, fer back as I can ricollect. I hev nuver knowed hit to
fail." The lad had risen on one elbow. His face was pale and uneasy, and
he averted it when the miller turned in the door.</p>

<p>"You'd better stay hyeh, son, 'n' finish up the grist. Hit won't take
long. Hev ye got victuals fer yer supper?</p>

<p>Isom nodded, without looking around, and when old Gabe was gone he
rose nervously and dropped helplessly back to the floor.</p>

<p>"'Pears like old Gabe knows I killed Jass," he breathed, sullenly.
'Pears like all of 'em knows hit, 'n' air jus' a-tormentin' me."</p>

<p>Nobody dreamed that the boy and his old gun had ended that fight on
the cliff; and without knowing it, old Gabe kept the lad in constant
torture with his talk of the blood-penalty. But Isom got used to it in
time, for he had shot to save his brother's life. Steve Marcum treated
him thereafter as an equal. Steve's friends, too, changed in manner
towards him because Steve had. And now, just when he had reached the
point of wondering whether, after all, there might not be one thing that
old Gabe did not know, Crump had come along with the miller's story,
which he had got from still another, a circuit-rider, who must know the
truth. The fact gave him trouble.</p>

<p>"Mebbe hit's goin' to happen when I goes with Steve atter ole
Brayton," he mumbled, and he sat thinking the matter over, until a rattle
and a whir inside the mill told him that the hopper was empty. He arose
to fill it, and coming out again, he heard hoof-beats on the dirt road. A
stranger rode around the rhododendrons and shouted to him, asking the
distance to Hazlan. He took off his hat when Isom answered, to wipe the
dust and perspiration from his face, and the boy saw a white scar across
his forehead. A little awestricken, the lad walked towards him.</p>

<p>"Air you the new rider whut's goin' to preach up to Hazlan? " he
asked.</p>

<p>Raines smiled at the solemnity of the little fellow. " Yes," he said,
kindly. " Won't you come up and hear me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," he said, and his lips parted as though he wanted to say
something else, but Raines did not notice.</p>

<p>"I wished I had axed him," he said, watching the preacher ride away. "
Uncle Gabe knows might' nigh ever'thing, 'n' he says so. Crump said the
rider said so; but Crump might 'a' been lyin'. He 'most al'ays is. I
wished I had axed him."</p>

<p>Mechanically the lad walked along the millrace, which was made of hewn
boards and hollow logs. In every crevice grass hung in thick bunches to
the ground or tipped wiry blades over the running water. Tightening a
prop where some silvery jet was getting too large, he lifted the
tail-gate a trifle and lay down again on the platform near the old wheel.
Out in the mill-pond the water would break now and then into ripples
about some unwary moth, and the white belly of a fish would flash from
the surface. It was the only sharp accent on the air. The chant of the
katydids had become a chorus, and the hush of darkness was settling over
the steady flow of water and the low drone of the millstones.</p>

<p>"I hain't afeerd," he kept saying to himself. "I hain't afeerd o'
nothin' nor no-body; but he lay brooding until his head throbbed, until
darkness filled the narrow gorge, and the strip of dark blue up through
the trees was pointed with faint stars. He was troubled when he rose, and
climbed on Rome's horse and rode homeward -so troubled that he turned
finally and started back in a gallop for Hazlan.</p>

<p>It was almost as Crump had said. There was no church in Hazlan, and,
as in Breathitt, the people had to follow Raines outside the town, and he
preached from the roadside. The rider's Master never had a tabernacle
more simple: overhead the stars and a low moon; close about, the trees
still and heavy with summer; a pine torch over his head like a yellow
plume; two tallow dips hung to a beech on one side, and flicking to the
other the shadows of the people who sat under them. A few Marcums and
Braytons were there, one faction shadowed on Raines's right, one on his
left. Between them the rider stood straight, and prayed as though talking
with some one among the stars. Behind him the voice of the woman at her
tiny organ rose among the leaves. And then he spoke as he had prayed; and
from the first they listened like children, while in their own homely
speech he went on to tell them, just as he would have told children, a
story that some of them had never heard before. "Forgive your enemies as
He had forgiven his," that was his plea. Marcums and Braytons began to
press in from the darkness on each side, forgetting each other as the
rest of the people forgot them. And when the story was quite done, Raines
stood a full minute without a word. No one was prepared for what
followed. Abruptly his voice rose sternly-" Thou shalt not kill" ; and
then Satan took shape under the torch. The man was transformed, swaying
half crouched before them. The long black hair fell across the white
scar, and picture after picture leaped from his tongue with such
vividness that a low wail started through the audience, and women sobbed
in their bonnets. It was penalty for bloodshed -not in this world:
penalty eternal in the next; and one slight figure under the dips
staggered suddenly aside into the darkness.</p>

<p>It was Isom; and no soul possessed of devils was ever more torn than
his, when he splashed through Troubled Fork and rode away that night.
Half a mile on he tried to keep his eyes on his horse's neck, anywhere
except on one high gray rock to which they were raised against his
will-the peak under which he had killed young Jasper. There it was
staring into the moon, but watching him as he fled through the woods,
shuddering at shadows, dodging branches that caught at him as he passed,
and on in a run, until he drew rein and slipped from his saddle at the
friendly old mill. There was no terror for him there. There every bush
was a friend; every beech trunk a sentinel on guard for him in shining
armor.</p>

<p>It was the old struggle that he was starting through that night-the
old fight of humanity from savage to Christian; and the lad fought it
until, with the birth of his wavering soul, the premonitions of the first
dawn came on. The patches of moonlight shifted, paling. The beech columns
mottled slowly with gray and brown. A ruddy streak was cleaving the east
like a slow sword of fire. The chill air began to pulse and the mists to
stir. Moisture had gathered on the boy's sleeve. His horse was stamping
uneasily, and the lad rose stiffly, his face gray but calm, and started
home. At old Gabe's gate he turned in his saddle to look where, under the
last sinking star, was once the home of his old enemies. Farther down,
under the crest, was old Steve Brayton, alive, and at that moment perhaps
asleep.</p>

<p>"Forgive your enemies;" that was the rider's plea. Forgive old Steve,
who had mocked him, and had driven Rome from the mountains; who had
threatened old Gabe's life,. and had shot Steve Marcum almost to death!
The lad drew breath quickly, and standing in his stirrups, stretched out
his fist, and let it drop, slowly.</p>

<h3><a name="aii">II</a></h3>

<p>OLD Gabe was just starting out when Isom' reached the cabin, and the
old man thought the boy had been at the mill all night. Isom slept
through the day, and spoke hardly a word when the miller came home,
though the latter had much to say of Raines, the two Steves, and of the
trouble possible. He gave some excuse for not going with old Gabe the
next day, and instead went into the woods alone.</p>

<p>Late in the middle of the afternoon he reached the mill. Old Gabe sat
smoking outside the door, and Isom stretched himself out on the platform
close to the water, shading his eyes from the rich sunlight with one
ragged sleeve.</p>

<p>"Uncl' Gabe," he said, suddenly, " s'posin' Steve Brayton was to step
out'n the bushes thar some mawnin' 'n' pull down his Winchester on ye,
would ye say, ' Lawd, fergive him, fer he don't know whut he do'?"</p>

<p>Old Gabe had told him once about a Stetson and a Lewallen who were
heard half a mile away praying while they fought each other to death with
Winchesters. There was no use prayin' an' shootin'," the miller declared.
There was but one way for them to escape damnation; that was to throw
down their guns and make friends. But the miller had forgotten, and his
mood that morning was whimsical.</p>

<p>Well, I mought, Isom," he said, " ef I didn't happen to have a gun
handy."</p>

<p>The humor was lost on Isom. His chin was moving up and down, and his
face was serious. That was just it. He could forgive Jass-Jass was dead;
he could forgive Crump, if he caught him in no devilment; old Brayton
even-after Steve's revenge was done. But now- The boy rose, shaking his
head.</p>

<p>Uncl' Gabe," he said with sudden passion, "whut ye reckon Rome's
a-doin'?"</p>

<p>The miller looked a little petulant. " Don't ye git tired axin' me
thet question, Isom? Rome's a-scratchin' right peert fer a livin', I
reckon, fer hisself 'n' Marthy. Yes, 'n' mebbe fer a young 'un too by
this time. Ef ye air honin' fer Rome, why don't ye rack out 'n' go to
him? Lawd knows I'd hate ter see ye go, but I tol' Rome I'd let ye
whenever ye got ready, 'n' so I will."</p>

<p>Isom had no answer, and old Gabe was puzzled. It was always this way.
The boy longed for Rome, the miller could see. He spoke of him sometimes
with tears, and sometimes he seemed to be on the point of going to him,
but he shrank inexplicably when the time for leaving came.</p>

<p>Isom started into the mill now without a word, as usual. Old Gabe
noticed that his feet were unsteady, and with quick remorse began to
question him.</p>

<p>" Kinder puny, hain't ye, Isom?</p>

<p>" Well, I hain't feelin' much peert."</p>

<p>" Hit was mighty keerless," old Gabe said, with kindly reproach, "
swimmin' the crick atter a fresh."</p>

<p>Hit wasn't the swimmin'," he protested, dropping weakly at the
threshold. "Hit was settin' out n the woods. I was in Hazlan t'other
night, Und' Gabe, to hear the new rider."</p>

<p>The miller looked around with quick interest. "I've been skeered afore
by riders a-tellin' 'bout the torments o' hell, but I never heerd nothin'
like his tellin' 'bout the Lord. He said the Lord was jes as pore as
anybody thar, and lived jes as rough; thet He made fences and barns n'
ox-yokes 'n' sech like, an' He couldn't write His own name when He
started out to save the worl'; an' when he come to the p'int whar His
enemies tuk hol' of Him, the rider jes crossed his fingers up over his
head 'n' axed us if we didn't know how it hurt to run a splinter into a
feller's hand when he's loggin' or a thorn into yer foot when ye're goin'
barefooted.</p>

<p>Hit jes made me sick, Uncl' Gabe, hearin' him tell how they stretched
Him out on a cross o' wood, when He'd come down fer nothin' but to save
'em, 'n' stuck a spear big as a co'n-knife into His side, 'n' give Him
vinegar, 'n' let Him hang thar 'n' die, with His own mammy a-stand-in'
down on the groun' a-cryin' 'n' watchin' Him. Some folks thar never heerd
sech afore. The women was a-rockin', 'n' ole Granny Day axed right out ef
thet tuk place a long time ago; 'n' the rider said, 'Yes, a long time
ago, mos two thousand years.' Granny was a-cryin', Uncl' Gabe, 'n' she
said, sorter soft, ' Stranger, let's hope that hit hain't so ' ; 'n' the
rider says, But hit air so; n' He fergive em while they was doin' it.'
Thet's whut got me, Uncl' Gabe, 'n' when the woman got to singin',
somethin' kinder broke loose hyeh "-Isom passed his hand over his thin
chest-" 'n' I couldn't git breath. I was mos' afeerd to ride home. I jes
layed at the mill studyin', till I thought my head would bust. I reckon
hit was the spent a-work-in me. Looks like I was mos' convicted, Uncl'
Gabe." His voice trembled and he stopped. Crump was a-lyin'," he cried,
suddenly. "But hit's wuss, Und' Gabe; hit's wuss! You say a life fer a
life in this worl'; the rider says hit's in the next, 'n' I'm mis'ble,
Uncl' Gabe. Ef Rome-I wish Rome was hyeh," he cried, helplessly. "I don't
know whut to do."</p>

<p>The miller rose and limped within the mill, and ran one hand through
the shifting corn. He stood in the doorway, looking long and perplexedly
towards Hazlan; he finally saw, he thought, just what the lad's trouble
was. He could give him some comfort, and he got his chair and dragged it
out to the door across the platform, and sat down in silence.</p>

<p>Isom," he said at last, "the Spent air shorely a-workin' ye, 'n' I'm
glad of it. But ye mus 'n t worry about the penalty a-fallin' on Rome.
Steve Marcum killed Jass-he can't fool me-'n' I've told Steve he's got
thet penalty to pay ef he gits up this trouble. I'm glad the Spent's
a-workin' ye, but ye mus'n' t worry 'bout Rome."</p>

<p>Isom rose suddenly on one elbow, and with a moan lay back and crossed
his arms over his face.</p>

<p>Old Gabe turned and left him.</p>

<p>Git up, Isom." It was the miller's voice again, an hour later. "You
better go home now. Ride the hoss, boy," he and, kindly.</p>

<p>Isom rose, and old Gabe helped him mount, and stood at the door. The
horse started, but the boy pulled him to a standstill again.</p>

<p>"I want to ax ye jes one thing more, Uncl' Gabe," he said, slowly."
S'posin' Steve had a-killed Jass to keep him from killin' Rome, hev he
got to be damned fer it jes the same? Hev he got to give up eternal life
anyways? Hain't thar no way out'n it-no way?"</p>

<p>There was need for close distinction now and the miller was
deliberate.</p>

<p>Ef Steve shot Jass," he said, " jes to save Rome's life-he had the
right to shoot him. Thar hain't no doubt 'bout that. The law says so. But
"-there was a judicial pause-"I've heerd Steve say that he hated Jass
wuss' n anybody on earth, 'cept old Brayton; 'n' ef he wus glad o' the
chance o' killin' him, why-the Lord air merciful, Isom; the Bible air
true, 'n' hit says an ' eye fer an eye, a tooth fer a tooth,' 'n' I never
knowed hit to fail-but the Lord air merciful. Ef Steve would only jes
repent, 'n' ef, 'stid o' fightin' the Lord by takin' human life, he'd
fight fer Him by savin' it, I reckon the Lord would fergive him. Fer ef
ye lose yer life fer Him, He do say you'll find it agin
somewhar-sometime.</p>

<p>Old Gabe did not see the sullen despair that came into the boy's tense
face. The subtlety of the answer had taken the old man back to the days
when he was magistrate, and his eyes were half closed. Isom rode away
without a word. From the dark of the mill old Gabe turned to look after
him again.</p>

<p>"I'm afeerd he's a-gittin' feverish agin. Hit looks like he's
convicted; but "-he knew the wavering nature of the boy-" I don't know-I
don't know."</p>

<p>Going home an hour later, the old man saw several mountaineers
climbing the path towards Steve Marcum's cabin; it meant the brewing of
mischief; and when he stopped at his own gate, he saw at the bend of the
road a figure creep from the bushes on one side into the bushes on the
other.</p>

<p>It looked like Crump.</p>

<h3><a name="aiii">III</a></h3>

<p>IT was Crump, and fifty yards behind him was Isom, slipping through
the brush after him -Isom's evil spirit-old Gabe, Raines, " conviction,"
blood-penalty, forgotten, all lost in the passion of a chase which has no
parallel when the game is man.</p>

<p>Straight up the ravine Crump went along a path which led to Steve
Marcum's cabin. There was a clump of rhododendron at the head of the
ravine, and near Steve's cabin. About this hour Marcum would be chopping
wood for supper, or sitting out in his porch in easy range from the
thicket. Crump's plan was plain: he was about his revenge early, and Isom
was exultant.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, Eli, you won't git Steve this time. Oh, naw!</p>

<p>The bushes were soon so thick that he could no longer follow Crump by
sight, and every few yards he had to stop to listen, and then steal on
like a mountain-cat towards the leaves rustling ahead of him. Half-way up
the ravine Crump turned to the right and stopped. Puzzled, Isom pushed so
close that the spy, standing irresolute on the edge of the path, whirled
around. The boy sank to his face, and in a moment footsteps started and
grew faint; Crump had darted across the path, and was running through the
undergrowth up the spur. Isom rose and hurried after him; and when,
panting hard, he reached the top, the spy's skulking figure was sliding
from Steve's house and towards the Breathitt road; and with a hot,
puzzled face, the boy went down after it.</p>

<p>On a little knob just over a sudden turn in the road Crump stopped,
and looking sharply about him, laid his gun down. Just in front of him
were two rocks, waist-high, with a crevice between them. Drawing a long
knife from his pocket, he climbed upon them, and began to cut carefully
away the spreading top of a bush that grew on the other side. Isom
crawled down towards him like a lizard, from tree to tree. A moment later
the spy was filling up the crevice with stones, and Isom knew what he was
about; he was making a "blind" to waylay Steve, who, the boy knew, was
going to Breathitt by that road the next Sunday. How did Crump know
that-how did he know everything? The crevice filled, Crump cut branches
and stuck them between the rocks. Then he pushed his rifle through the
twigs, and taking aim several times, withdrew it. When he turned away at
last and started down to the road, he looked back once more, and Isom saw
him grinning. Almost chuckling in answer, the lad slipped around the knob
to the road the other way, and Crump threw up his gun with a gasp of
fright when a figure rose out of the dusk before him.</p>

<p>Hol' on, Eli ! " said Isom, easily. " Don't git skeered! Hit's nobody
but me. Whar ye been?"</p>

<p>Crump laughed, so quick was he disarmed of suspicion. " Jes up the
river a piece to see Aunt Sally Day. She's a fust cousin o' mine by
marriage.</p>

<p>Jsom's right hand was slipping back as if to rest on his hip. "D'you
say you'd been 'convicted,' Eli?</p>

<p>Crump's answer was chantlike. "Yes, Lawd reckon I have."</p>

<p>Goin' to stop all o' yer lyin', air ye, ' Isom went on, in the same
tone, and Crump twitched as though struck suddenly from behind, "an'
stealin' 'n' lay-wayin'?"</p>

<p>"Look a-hyeh, boy-" he began, roughly, and mumbling a threat, started
on.</p>

<p>Uh, Eli! " Even then the easy voice fooled him again, and he turned.
Isom had a big revolver on a line with his breast. " Drap yer gun! " he
said, tremulously.</p>

<p>Crump tried to laugh, but his guilty face turned gray. "Take keer,
boy," he gasped; "yer gun's cocked. Take keer, I tell ye!</p>

<p>Drap it, damn ye! " Isom called in sudden fury, " 'n' git clean away
from it! " Crump backed, and Isom came forward and stood with one foot on
the fallen Winchester.</p>

<p>"I seed ye, Eli. Been makin' a blind fer Steve, hev ye? Coin' to shoot
him in the back, too, air ye? You're ketched at last, Eli. You've done a
heap o' devilmcnt. You're gittin' wuss all the time. You oughter be dead,
'n' now-"</p>

<p>Crump found voice in a cry of terror and a whine for mercy. The boy
looked at him, unable to speak his contempt.</p>

<p>"Cit down thar! " he said, finally; and Crump, knowing what was
wanted, stretched himself in the road. Isom sat down on a stone, the big
pistol across one knee.</p>

<p>"Roll over! " Crump rolled at full length.</p>

<p>"Git up! " Isom laughed wickedly. "Ye don't look purty, Eli." He
lifted the pistol and nipped a cake of dirt from the road between Crump's
feet. With another cry of fear, the spy began a vigorous dance.</p>

<p>"Hol' on, Eli; I don't want ye to dance. Ye belong to the chu'ch now,
'n' I wouldn't have ye go agin yer religion fer nothin'. Stan' still!
Another bullet and another cut between Crump's feet. "Pears like ye don't
think I kin shoot straight. Eli," he went on, reloading the empty
chambers, " some folks think I'm a idgit, 'n' I know 'em. Do you think
I'm a idgit, Eli?"</p>

<p>Actin' mighty nateral now." Isom was raising the pistol again. " Oh,
Lawdy! Don't shoot, boy-don't shoot!</p>

<p>"Cit down on yer knees! Now I want ye to beg fer mercy thet ye never
showed-thet ye wouldn't 'a' showed Steve. . . Purty good," he said,
encouragingly.</p>

<p>Mebbe ye kin pray a leetle, seem' ez ye air a chu'ch member. Pray fer
yer enemies, Eli; Uncl' Gabe says ye must love yer enemies. I know how ye
loves me, 'n' I want yer to pray fer me. The Lawd mus' sot a powerful
store by a good citizen like you. Ax him to fergive me fer killin'
ye."</p>

<p>"Have mercy, O Lawd," prayed Crump, to command-and the prayer was
subtle-" on the murderer of this Thy servant. A life fer a life, Thou hev
said, O Lawd. Fer killin' me he will foller me, 'n' ef Ye hev not mussy
he is boun' fer the lowes' pit o' hell, O Lawd</p>

<p>It was Isom's time to wince now, and Crum p's pious groan was cut
short.</p>

<p>Shet up! " cried the boy, sharply, and he sat a moment silent. "You've
been a-spyin' on us sence I was borned, Eli," he said, reflectively.</p>

<p>"I believe ye lay-wayed dad. Y'u spied on Rome. Y'u told the soldiers
whar he was a-hidin' Y'u tried to shoot him from the bresh. Y'u found out
Steve was goin' to Breathitt on Sunday, 'n' you've jes made a blind to
shoot him in the back. I reckon thar's no meanness ye hain't done. Dad's
al'ays said ye sot a snare fer a woman once-a woman! Y'u loaded a musket
with slugs, 'n' tied a string to the trigger, 'n' stretched hit 'cross
the path, 'n' y'u got up on a cliff 'n' whistled to make her slow up jes
when she struck the string. I reckon thet's yer wust-but I don't
know."</p>

<p>Several times Crump raised his hands in protest while his arraignment
was going on; several times he tried to speak, but his lips refused
utterance. The boy's voice was getting thicker and thicker, and he was
nervously working the cock of the big pistol up and down.</p>

<p>"Cit up," he said; and Crump rose with a spring. The lad's tone meant
release.</p>

<p>"You hain't wuth the risk. I hain't goin' ter kill ye. I jus' wanted
ter banter ye 'n' make ye beg. You're a good beggar, Eli, 'n' a powerful
prayer. You'll be a shinin' light in the chu'ch, ef ye gits a chance ter
shine long. Fer lemme tell ye, nobody ever ketched ye afore. But you're
ketched now, an' I'm goin' to tell Steve. He'll be a-watchin' fer ye, 'n'
so 'll I. I tell ye in time, ef ye ever come over hyeh agin as long as
you live, you'll never git back alive. Turn roun'! Hev ye got any balls?
" he asked, feeling in Crump's pockets for cartridges. " No; well -he
picked up the Winchester and pumped the magazine empty-" I'll keep
these," he said, handing Crump the empty rifle. "Now git away-an' git
away quick!</p>

<p>Crump's slouching footsteps went out of hearing, and Isom sat where he
was. His elbows dropped to his knees. His face dropped slowly into his
hands, and the nettles of remorse began to sting. He took the back of one
tremulous hand presently to wipe the perspiration from his forehead, and
he found it burning. A sharp pain shot through his eyes. He knew what
that meant, and feeling dizzy, he rose and started a little blindly
towards home.</p>

<p>Old Gabe was waiting for him. He did not answer the old man's
querulous inquiry, but stumbled towards a bed. An hour later, when the
miller was rubbing his forehead, he opened his eyes, shut them, and began
to talk.</p>

<p>"I reckon I hain't much better 'n Eli, Und' Gabe," he said,
plaintively. "I've been abusin' him down thar in the woods. I come might'
nigh killin' him onct." The old man stroked on, scarcely heeding the
boy's words, so much nonsense would he talk when ill.</p>

<p>I've been lyin' to ye, Unci' Gabe, 'n' a-deceivin' of ye right along.
Steve's a-goin' atter ole Brayton-I'm goin' too-Steve didn't kill
Jass-hit wusn't Steve-hit wusn't Rome-hit was-" The last word stopped
behind his shaking lips; he rose suddenly in bed, looked wildly into the
miller's startled face, and dropping with a sob to the bed, went sobbing
to sleep.</p>

<p>Old Gabe went back to his pipe, and while he smoked, his figure shrank
slowly in his chair. He went to bed finally, but sleep would not come,
and he rose again and built up the fire and sat by it, waiting for day.
His own doctrine, sternly taught for many a year, had come home to him;
and the miller's face when he opened his door was gray as the breaking
light.</p>

<h3><a name="aiv">IV</a></h3>

<p>THERE was little peace for old Gabe that day at the mill. And when he
went home at night he found cause for the thousand premonitions that had
haunted him. The lad was gone.</p>

<p>A faint light in the east was heralding the moon when Isom reached
Steve Marcum's gate. There were several horses hitched to the fence,
several dim forms seated in the porch, and the lad halboed for Steve,
whose shadow shot instantly from the door and came towards him.</p>

<p>Glad ter see ye, Isom," he called, jubilantly. I was jus' about to
sen' fer ye. How'd ye happen to come up?"</p>

<p>Isom answered in a low voice with the news of Crump's "blind," and
Steve laughed and swore in the same breath.</p>

<p>"Come hyeh!" he said, leading the way back; and at the porch he had
Isom tell the story again.</p>

<p>Whut d' I tell ye, boys? " he asked, triumphantly. "Don't believe ye
more 'n half believed me."</p>

<p>Three more horsemen rode up to the gate and came into the light. Every
man was armed, and at Isom's puzzled look, Steve caught the lad by the
arm and led him around the chimney-corner. He was in high spirits.</p>

<p>"'Pears like ole times, Isom. I'm a-goin' fer thet cussed ole Steve
Brayton this very night. He's behind Crump. I s'picioned it afore; now I
know it for sartain. He's a-goin' to give Eli a mule 'n' a Winchester fer
killin' me. We're goin' to s'prise him to-night. He won't be look-in' fer
us-I've fixed that. I wus jus' about to sen' fer ye. I hain't fergot how
ye kin handle a gun." Steve laughed significantly. " Ye're a good frien'
o' mine, 'n' I'm goin' to show ye thet I'm a frien' o' yourn."</p>

<p>Isom's paleness was unnoticed in the dark. The old throbbing began to
beat again at his temple; the old haze started from his eyes.</p>

<p>"Hyeh's yer gun, Isom," he heard Steve saying next. The fire was
blazing into his face. At the chimney-corner was the bent figure of old
Daddy Marcum, and across his lap shone a Winchester. Steve was pointing
at it, his grim face radiant; the old rnan's toothless mouth was
grinning, and his sharp black eyes were snapping up at him.</p>

<p>"Hit's yourn, I tell ye," said Steve again. I aimed jes to lend it to
ye, but ye've saved me frum gittin' killed, mebbe, 'n' hit's yourn
now-yourn, boy, fer keeps."</p>

<p>Steve was holding the gun out to him now. The smooth cold touch of the
polished barrel thrilled him. It made everything for an instant clear
again, and feeling weak, Isom sat down on the bed, gripping the treasure
in both trembling hands. On one side of him some one was repeating
Steve's plan of attack. Old Brayton's cabin was nearly opposite, but they
would go up the river, cross above the mill, and ride back. The night was
cloudy, but they would have the moonlight now and then for the climb up
the mountain. They would creep close, and when the moon was hid they
would run in and get old Brayton alive, if possible. Then-the rest was
with Steve.</p>

<p>Across the room he could hear Steve telling the three new-comers, with
an occasional curse, about Crump's blind, and how he knew that old
Brayton was hiring Crump.</p>

<p>Old Steve's meaner 'n Eli," he said to himself, and a flame of the old
hate surged up from the fire of temptation in his heart. Steve Marcum was
his best friend; Steve had shielded him. The boy had promised to join him
against old Brayton, and here was the Winchester, brand-new, to bind his
word.</p>

<p>"Git ready, boys; git ready."</p>

<p>It was Steve's voice, and in Isom's ears the preacher's voice rang
after it. Again that blinding mist before his eyes, and the boy brushed
at it irritably. He could see the men buckling cartridge-belts, but he
sat still. Two or three men were going out. Daddy Marcum was leaning on a
chair at the door, looking eagerly at each man as he passed.</p>

<p>Hain't ye goin', Isom?</p>

<p>Somebody was standing before him twirling a rifle on its butt, a boy
near Isom's age. The whirling gun made him dizzy.</p>

<p>Stop it! " he cried, angrily. Old Daddy Marcum was answering the boy's
question from the door.</p>

<p>"Isom goin'?" he piped, proudly. "I reckon he air. Whar's yer belt,
boy? Git ready. Git ready."</p>

<p>Isom rose then-he could not answer sitting down-and caught at a
bedpost with one hand, while he fumbled at his throat with the other.</p>

<p>"I hain't goin'."</p>

<p>Steve heard at the door, and whirled around. Daddy Marcum was
tottering across the floor, with one bony hand uplifted.</p>

<p>"You're a coward! " The name stilled every sound. Isom, with eyes
afire, sprang at the old man to strike, but somebody caught his arm and
forced him back to the bed.</p>

<p>"Shet up, dad," said Steve, angrily, looking sharply into Isom's face.
" Don't ye see the boy's sick? He needn't go ef he don't want to. Time to
start, boys."</p>

<p>The tramp of heavy boots started across the puncheon floor and porch
again. Isom could hear Steve's orders outside; the laughs and jeers and
curses of the men as they mounted their horses; he heard the cavalcade
pass through the gate, the old man's cackling good-by; then the horses'
hoofs going down the mountain, and Daddy Marcum's hobbling step on the
porch again. He was standing in the middle of the floor, full in the
firelight, when the old man reached the threshold-standing in a trance,
with a cartridge-belt in his hand.</p>

<p>"Good fer you, Isom</p>

<p>The cry was apologetic, and stopped short.</p>

<p>The critter's fersakcn," he quavered, and cowed by the boy's strange
look, the old man shrank away from him along the wall. But Isom seemed
neither to see nor hear. He caught up his rifle, and, wavering an
instant, tossed it with the belt on the bed and ran out the door. The old
man followed, dumb with amazement.</p>

<p>Isom! " he called, getting his wits and his tongue at last. "Hyeh's
yer gun! Come back, I tell ye! You've fergot yer gun! Isom! Isom!</p>

<p>The voice piped shrilly out into the darkness, and piped back without
answer.</p>

<p>A steep path, dangerous even by day, ran snakelike from the cabin down
to the water's edge. It was called Isom's path after that tragic night.
No mountaineer went down it thereafter without a firm faith that only by
the direct help of Heaven could the boy, in his flight down through the
dark, have reached the river and the other side alive. The path dropped
from ledge to ledge, and ran the brink of precipices and chasms. In a
dozen places the boy crashed through the undergrowth from one slippery
fold to the next below, catching at roots and stones, slipping past death
a score of times, and dropping on till a flood of yellow light lashed the
gloom before him. Just there the river was most narrow; the nose of a
cliff swerved the current sharply across, and on the other side an eddy
ran from it up stream. These earthly helps he had, and he needed
them.</p>

<p>There had been a rain-storm, and the waves swept him away like
thistle-down, and beat back at him as he fought through them and stood
choked and panting on the other shore. He did not dare stop to rest. The
Marcums, too, had crossed the river up at the ford by this time, and were
galloping towards him; and Isom started on and up. When he reached the
first bench of the spur the moon was swinging over Thunderstruck Knob.
The clouds broke as he clinibed; strips of radiant sky showed between the
rolling masses, and the mountain above was light and dark in quick
succession. He had no breath when he reached the ledge that ran below old
Steve's cabin, and flinging one arm above it, he fell through sheer
exhaustion. The cabin was dark as the clump of firs behind it; the
inmates were unsuspecting; and Steve Marcum and his men were not far
below. A rumbling started under him, while he lay there and grew
faint-the rumble of a stone knocked from the path by a horse's hoof. Isom
tried to halbo, but his voice stopped in a whisper, and he painfully drew
himself upon the rock, upright under the bright moon. A quick oath of
warning came then-it was Crump's shrill voice in the Brayton cabin-and
Isom stumbled forward with both hands thrown up and a gasping cry at his
lips. One flash came through a port-hole of the cabin. A yell broke on
the night-Crump's cry again-and the boy swayed across the rock, and
falling at the brink, dropped with a limp struggle out of sight.</p>

<h3><a name="av">V</a></h3>

<p>THE news of Isom's fate reached the miller by way of Hazlan before the
next noon. Several men in the Brayton cabin had recognized the boy in the
moonlight. At daybreak they found bloodstains on the ledge and on a
narrow shelf a few feet farther down. Isom had slipped from one to the
other, they said, and in his last struggle had rolled over into Dead
Creek, and had been swept into the Cumberland.</p>

<p>It was Crump who had warned the Braytons. Nobody ever knew how he had
learned Steve Marcum's purpose. And old Brayton on his guard and in his
own cabin was impregnable. So the Marcums, after a harmless fusillade,
had turned back cursing. Mocking shouts followed after them,
pistol-shots, even the scraping of a fiddle and shuffling on the ledge.
But they kept on, cursing across the river and back to Daddy Marcum, who
was standing in the porch, peermg for them through the dawn, with a story
to tell about Isom.</p>

<p>" The critter was teched in the head," the old man said, and this was
what the Braytons, too, believed. But Steve Marcum, going to search for
Isom's body next day, gave old Gabe another theory. He told the miller
how Daddy Marcum had called Isom a coward, and Steve said the boy had
gone ahead to prove he was no coward.</p>

<p>"He had mighty leetle call to prove it to me. Think o' his takin' ole
Brayton all by hisself! he said, with a look at the yellow, heaving
Cumberland. "'N', Lord! think o' his swimmin' that river in the dark!</p>

<p>Old Gabe asked a question fiercely then and demanded the truth, and
Steve told him about the hand-to-hand fight on the mountain-side, about
young Jasper's treachery, and how the boy, who was watching the fight,
fired just in time to save Rome. It made all plain at last-Rome's and
Steve's denials, Isom's dinning on that one theme,' and why the boy could
not go to Rome and face Martha, with her own blood on his hands. Isom's
true motive, too, was plain, and the miller told it brokenly to Steve,
who rode away with a low whistle to tell it broadcast, and left the old
man rocking his body like a woman.</p>

<p>An hour later he rode back at a gallop to tell old Gabe to search the
river bank below the mill. He did not believe Isom dead. It was just his
feelin'," he said, and one fact, that nobody else thought important - the
Brayton canoe was gone.</p>

<p>Ef he was jus' scamped by a ball," said Steve, "you kin bet he tuk the
boat, 'n' he's down thar in the bushes somewhar now waitin' fer
dark."</p>

<p>And about dusk, sure enough, old Gabe, wandering hopefully through the
thicket below the mill, stumbled over the canoe stranded in the bushes.
In the new mud were the tracks of a boy's bare feet leading into the
thicket, and the miller made straight for home. When he opened his door
he began to shake as if with palsy. A figure was seated on the hearth
against the chimney, and the firelight was playing over the face and
hair. The lips were parted, and the head hung limply to the breast. The
clothes were torn to rags, and one shoulder was bare. Through the upper
flesh of it and close to the nrck was an ugly burrow clotted with blood.
The boy was asleep.</p>

<p>Three nights later, in Hazlan, Sherd Raines told the people of Isom's
flight down the mountain, across the river, and up the steep to save his
life by losing it. Before he was done, one gray-headed figure pressed
from the darkness on one side and stood trembling under the dips. It was
old Steve Brayton, who had fired from the cabin at Isom, and dropping his
Winchester, he stumbled forward with the butt of his pistol held out to
Raines. A Marcum appeared on the other side with the muzzle of his
Winchester down. Raines raised both hands then and imperiously called on
every man who had a weapon to come forward and give it up. Like children
they came, Marcums and Braytons, piling their arms on the rock before
him, shaking hands right and left, and sitting together on the mourner's
bench.</p>

<p>Old Brayton was humbled thereafter. He wanted to shake hands with
Steve Marcum and make friends. But Steve grinned, and said, "Not yit,"
and went off into the bushes. A few days later he went to Hazlan of his
own accord and gave up his gun to Raines. He wouldn't shake hands with
old Brayton, he said, nor with any other man who would hire another man
to do his "killin';" but he promised to fight no more, and he kept his
word.</p>

<p>A flood followed on New Year's day. Old Gabe's canoe-his second
canoe-was gone, and a Marcum and a Brayton worked side by side at the
mill hollowing out another. The miller sat at the door whittling.</p>

<p>"'Pears like folks is havin' bad luck with thar dugouts." said
Brayton. "Some trifin' cuss took old Steve Brayton's jes to cross the
river, without the grace to tie it to the bank, let 'lone takin' it back.
I've heard ez how Aunt Sally Day's boy Ben, who was a-fishin' that
evenin, says ez how he seed Isom's harnt a-floatin' across the river in
it, without techin' a paddle."</p>

<p>The Marcum laughed. "Idgits is thick over hyeh," he said. " Ben's
a-gittin' wuss sence Isom was killed. Yes, I recollect Gabe hyeh lost a
canoe jus' atter a flood more'n a year ago, when Rome Stetson 'n' Marthy
Lewallen went a-gallivantin' out' n the mountains together. Hyeh's
another flood, 'n' old Gabe's dugout gone agin." The miller raised a
covert glance of suspicion from under his hat, but the Marcum was
laughing. "Ye oughter put a trace-chain on this un," he added. "A rope
gits rotten in the water, 'n' a tide is mighty apt to break it."</p>

<p>Old Gabe said that "mebbe that wus so," but he had no chain to waste;
he reckoned a rope was strong enough, and he started home.</p>

<p>"Old Gabe don't seem to keer much now 'bout Isom," said the Brayton. "
Folks say he tuk on so awful at fust that hit looked like he wus goin'
crazy. He's gittin' downright peert again. Hello!</p>

<p>Bud Vickers was carrying a piece of news down to Hazlan, and he pulled
up his horse to deliver it. Aunt Sally Day's dog had been seen playing in
the Breathitt road with the frame of a human foot. Some boys had found
not far away, behind a withered" blind," a heap of rags and bones. Eli
Crump had not been seen in Hazlan since the night of the Marcum raid.</p>

<p>Well, ef hit was Eli," said the Brayton, waggishly, "we're all goin'
to be saved. Eli's case 'll come fust, an' ef thar's only one Jedgment
Day, the Lord 'll nuver git to us."</p>

<p>The three chuckled, while old Gabe sat dreammg at his gate. The boy
had lain quiet during the weeks of his getting well, absorbed in one
aim-to keep hidden until he was strong enough to get to Rome. On the last
night the miller had raised one of the old hearth-stones and had given
him the hire of many years. At daybreak the lad drifted away. Now old
Gabe was following him down the river and on to the dim mountain line,
where the boy's figure was plain for a moment against the sky, and then
was lost.</p>

<p>The clouds in the west had turned gray and the crescent had broken the
gloom of the woods into shadows when the miller rose. One star was coming
over Black Mountain from the east. It was the Star of Bethlehem to old
Gabe; and, starlike on both sides of the Cumberland, answering fires from
cabin hearths were giving back its message at last.</p>

<p>"Thar hain't nothin' to hender Rome 'n' Marthy now. I nuver knowed
anybody to stay 'way from these mount'ins ef he could git back; 'n' Isom
said he'd fetch 'em. Thar hain't notliin' to hender--nothin' now."</p>

<p>On the stoop of the cabin the miller turned to look again, and then on
the last Stetson the door was closed.</p>
